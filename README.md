 <h1 align="center">ü™™ | About me</h1>
 
I am a French developer and full-stack for 3 years. I am mainly specialized in the back-end.
My debut actually comes from 2020. My dad had just gotten a laptop and I was very excited to use it. I watched a tutorial to create a Discord bot and once again it was thanks to my father that I became interested in development. It was a very simple so no complexity in the code I had only one file of more than 200 lines with a code not optimized at all. I had fun doing that and then afterwards I spent less time on the laptop and it was in 2021 that I really started learning Javascript and more precisely Discord.js with my personal laptop. I watched tutorials again and made my first handler. I managed to optimize my code a bit and today I have several projects in progress. For me, JavaScript is life. You can do whatever you want with it. Discord Bot, GUI, Website, App, etc. I made developer friends who accompany me and with whom I also do projects. I always had this desire to create my own robots when I saw that many people were using them, it's also one of the reasons why I'm a developer. Now I have diversified. I do HTML/CSS and Python, I learn Typescript and I have fun. That's all that matters to me.
